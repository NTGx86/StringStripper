# StringStripper
Python script that filters the output from Strings.exe (Forensics/Malware Analysis tool). 

For those familiar with Strings.exe you're surely aware that more often than not the number of lines outputted
can be more than anyone wants to manual sift through. Hence, while learning malware analysis at the
University of Arizona I created a python script to filter out many of the lines that aren't relative to 
a malware analyst. 

As of May 2023, I'm working on adjusting it to do the equilivalent of grep for ".exe", "www.", ".com", etc. 

It can function as a standalone script or as part of a one liner taking command-line input. 

Expected availability June 2023. 

Additional Notes: This script just like many other on my GitHub page are tools that I delevoped as projects
in response to my cybersecurity engineering coursework at the University of Arizona. With that in mind, many 
of the functionality is not novel or groundbreaking, but simply a method for me to apply my skills and have 
fun with python.
